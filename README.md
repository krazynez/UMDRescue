UMDRescue is a UMD disc dumper allowing you to backup your UMD discs for personal use using a PSP. The kxploit version will create a 1:1 backup unlike the higher Firmware version. This is due to permissions it seems that Sony
decided to bump security up on runlevel permissions later on in higher Firmwares. The None kxploit version will still dump Games fine. Just nothing else on the UMD.

***Disclaimer***

Only dump UMDs that you legally own and do not share them with anyone.
This tool is not to be used for piracy under any circumstances.

#### Installation

* If your one a higher FW than 1.50 and *DO NOT* have the 1.50 Kernel Add-on. Use the UMDRescue in `PSP/GAME`
* If using 1.50 OFW or a CFW compatible with 1.50 Kernel Add-on you can use the kxploit version in `PSP/GAME150` both folders are required. If your on 1.50 OFW just rename the `GAME150` folder to `GAME`.
